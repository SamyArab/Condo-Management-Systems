# CondoMAXium - Don't Settle For Anything Less
<h2>A Condo Management Solution</h2>
<h3>Software Engineering Team Design Project (SOEN390 W24): TEAM 3</h3>

This system will allow for Condo Management Companies (CMC's) to create an interactive and centralized platform for the properties under their management while also allowing the tenants and owners to interact with the system and all matters related to their condo or even to communicate issues with the CMC.

TODO:
Have detailed and thorough documentation on how to access/download the software solution when we reach deployment phase.
